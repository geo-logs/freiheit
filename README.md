# Geo Cash Geld der Freiheit
We fund freedom.  
We stop [state criminals](https://privacy-is-not-a-crime.de).  
We make crypto cypherpunk again.  
We love Geo Caching with [Geo Cash](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb841A4f979F9510760ecf60512e038656E68f459).  
We foster Freedom, Justice and Peace.  
We foster sustainable liquidity infrastructures.  
We combine Crypto Education with [Geo Caching](https://Geo-Caching.org).  
We separate money from state criminals like religion has been separated from state.  
We foster ever emerging architectures of freedom by rewarding those who help themselves and others to be free.  

## Incentive Goals 
Some specific incentive goals of our experiments are: 

### Broad Distribution / Decentralization   
Geo Cachers can support this by following three simple steps:  
1. Generate, print and hide paperwallets via a [Paperwallet Generator](https://visitor-gateway-to-geo-caching.github.io/geo-caching-paperwallet-generator)    
2. Send matic to those paperwallets to ensure that people who find it can experiment on the blockchain easily   
3. Encourage people to buy [Geo Cash](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb841A4f979F9510760ecf60512e038656E68f459) so that they can post logs in the [Geo Log](https://geld-wandern.de)

### Sustainable Liquidity Infrastructures      
[We](https://github.com/moniquebaumann/friends-of-satoshi) made it difficult for centralized bad actors or matrix agents to exploit [Geo Cash](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb841A4f979F9510760ecf60512e038656E68f459).   
[We](https://github.com/moniquebaumann/friends-of-satoshi) encourage everyone to invest only very small amounts to incentivize an ongoing decentralization / distribution. We rely on wisdom of the free crowd.

### Education & Exploration   
[We](https://github.com/moniquebaumann/friends-of-satoshi) hope these experiments help to make crypto cypherpunk again.  
We foster the peer to peer cash space in the pure, honorable and respectful spirit of its inventors.
We encourage people to experiment themselves with small amounts of cash.
